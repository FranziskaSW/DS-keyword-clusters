        "--------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "When we sat down to conjure ideas for the project, Franzi shared with us David Kriesel's [Spiegel Mining](http://www.dkriesel.com/spiegelmining) talk, where he explored a database of articles that he himself scraped over several years from the German newsmagazine, Spiegel Online.\n",
        "\n",
        "We all liked the spirit of Kriesel's project, and wished to create a project in this spirit yet in the context of the course. Our main aspirations were to gain insight into a newspaper's publication policy through data mining & visualization, and to play and have fun with a huge amount of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "###The problems we chose to tackle were:\n",
        "- **Identifying stories in the sea of articles:** Finding sets of articles which are connected in some sense (either in a straight-forward way or in some deeper sense), so that they define a story.\n",
        "- **Finding trends in the newspaper's publications:** Developing tools to determine these trends so as to gain insight into the choices (conscious or unconscious) the newspaper's editors make.\n",
        "- **Analyzing the network of keywords:** Defining a network with article keywords as nodes, and edges defined by keywords' article-coappearance, and searching this network for insights about the newspaper's publication in a broad sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# The Data\n",
        "-------------\n",
        "Since this project is about textual data, we needed a language we could all understand, so English was our only option. Of all the English news' APIs, the NYT's API was the most promising: Although containing only article metadata (and for scraping articles' content you need an online subscription), it does have some cool features:\n",
        "- Has articles from 1851 (!) to date\n",
        "- Has **rich textual metadata**, including the following for each article:\n",
        "  - Headline and the lead paragraph\n",
        "  - Tagged keywords of 4 types: people, organizations, locations, creative works & subjects\n",
        "    - Subject being anything from \"Classified Information and State Secrets\" to \"#MeToo Movement\"\n",
        "  - News desk (A general category: Politics, Culture, Sports, etc.) and section of the magazine (More specific: Soccer, Middle East, Economy) it was published in\n",
        "  - Publication date & time\n",
        "- Is free & well maintained\n",
