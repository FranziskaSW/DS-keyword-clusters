We can assume that some of these keywords are \"section-specific\", i.e. they mostly appear in specific sections (for example, tennis players will mostly appear in the Sports section, while dancers would appear in Culture). But some keywords might appear in many different sections, (for example, 'New York' - it's the New York Times after all).\n",

        "| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |\n",
        "| 1    | 'Nuclear Weapons', 'Trump, Donald J', 'Kim Jong-un', 'North Korea', 'United States Defense and Military Forces' | World   |\n",
        "| 2    | 'Cats', 'Wildfires', 'Santa Rosa (California)'               | U.S.    |\n",

We will define the keywords network with the keywords as nodes, and add an edge between two keywords if they appeared together in an article.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will embed this graph in 2D in a way that represents the co-appearance connections between the keywords, visualizing the relations between the different sections of the newspaper. We will see if this network of keywords truthfully represents the sections of the newspaper.\n",

        "First, for each node we only took the most frequent 35% of its' edges to other nodes, but only, if the edge is mutually in the top 35% of both nodes (sort of like mutual K-nearest neighbours). With the 35%-rule, Trump can keep 849 nodes, but he is also included in the top 35% of 1951 other nodes. If we now only consider the mutual top 35%, Trump is left with 847 edges which means that two of his edges did not appear in the top-35% of the other edges. \n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to a clean cut of the 35% most frequent edges, this node-wise-35% assures that we also keep the nodes and edges in less common topics that would otherwise disappear from the graph. \n",

        "So far we made sure that the less common topics also stay in the graph. Another problem that leads to a messy graph is, that some keywords appear in disproportionately many articles compared to the others. This mainly touches hyper-keywords like \"Politics and Government\", \"United States\" and \"Trump, Donald J\" (of course). Therefore the Inverse Document Frequency value (idf-value) is used to reduce heaviness of the nodes. Instead of keeping the top 35% of the edges as proposed above, we only keep idf-value*35% (Trump can then only keep 7% of his edges) the idf-value is caluclated as below and then normalized to the maximum value so that we get values between 1 and 0, where 1: keyword appears the least often, 0: keyword appears in every article.\n",
